  for a re-encode entries task but was not provided.
INFO_TASK_NAME_REENCODE_ENTRIES=Re-Encode Entries Task
INFO_TASK_DESCRIPTION_REENCODE_ENTRIES=This task may be used to cause the \
  server to re-encode all or a specified set of entries in a local DB \
  backend.  This may be used to apply encoding changes around the use of \
  features like compression, encryption, cryptographic digests, and/or \
  uncached attributes or entries.

  Processor Base DN
INFO_DESCRIPTION_RELOAD_GLOBAL_INDEX_BASE_DN=The base DN of the \

  Rate (Entries/Second)
INFO_DESCRIPTION_RELOAD_GLOBAL_INDEX_MAX_ENTRIES_PER_SECOND=An optional \
  target maximum rate at which entries should be reloaded.  A value of zero \
  indicates no limit.  If this is not specified, then the rate limit will be \
  determined from the Directory Proxy Server configuration.
ERR_RELOAD_GLOBAL_INDEX_MISSING_REQUIRED_ATTR=Unable to create a reload \
  global index task from the provided entry because the required ''{0}'' \
  attribute was not included.
